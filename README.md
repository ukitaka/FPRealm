`RealmIO` makes `Realm` operation more safely, reusable and composable by using `reader monad`.

## Motivation

Realm operations (especially `write` operations) is not reusable if you write a function as follows:

```swift
func addDog(name: String) throws {
    let realm = try Realm()
    try realm.write {
        let dog = Dog()
        dog.name = name
        realm.add(dog)
    }
}
``` 

At first glance, It works well, but actually there are some problems if you call this function multiple times.

```swift
addDog(name: "Taro")
addDog(name: "Jiro")
```

+ You cannot add 2 dog objects in a same transaction. In this case, `realm.write` is called twice.
+ Typically, to begin transaction is very slow, and `realm.write` locks realm instance.  We should not call `realm.write` needlessly.

You can also write this function as follows:

```swift
func addDog(name: String, to realm: Realm) {
    let dog = Dog()
    dog.name = name
    realm.add(dog)
}
``` 

```swift
try realm.write {
    addDog(name: "Taro", to: realm)
    addDog(name: "Jiro", to: realm)
}
```

2 `addDog` calls will be run in a same transaction, but user needs to call `realm.write` by oneself. 
+ The user can not judge from the signature whether to begin a transaction by oneself.
+ It is sometimes painfully to pass `Realm` instance as argument explicitly.

## Usage

### Define Realm operation as `RealmIO`

`RealmIO<RW, T>` represents a realm operation.

+ `RW` is actually `Read` or `Write`. It represents that operation is readonly or not.
+ `T` is a return value type.

and you can also use `RealmRead<T>` and `RealmWrite<T>`, these are just alias of `RealmIO<Read, T>` and `RealmIO<Write, T>` .

```swift
public typealias RealmRead<T> = RealmIO<Read, T>

public typealias RealmWrite<T> = RealmIO<Write, T>
```

For example, operation that reads `User` object from realm is typed `RealmRead<User>`.

```swift
func find(by userID: Int) -> RealmRead<User> {
    ...
}
```

If you already know about `reader monad`, `RealmIO<RW, T>` is the same as `Reader<Realm, T>`, except for the `RW` type parameter.

### Run Realm operation with `realm.run(io:)`

You can run preceding realm operation with `realm.run(io:)`.

```swift
let io: RealmRead<User> = find(by: 123)
let result = try? realm.run(io: io)
```

If operation needs to write to realm (it means `io` is an instance of `RealmWrite<T>`),
`realm.run(io:)` begins transaction automatically.

`realm.run(io:)` throws 2 error types.

+ `Realm.Error`
+ Error that thrown by user

### Compose realm operation with `flatMap`

`flatMap` allows you to compose realm actions.

```swift
func add(dog: Dog) -> RealmWrite<Void> {
    ...
}

func add(cat: Cat) -> RealmWrite<Void> {
    ...
}

let io: RealmWrite<Void> = add(dog: myDog).flatMap { _ in add(cat: myCat) }
```

And you can run composed operation **in a same transaction**.

```swift
realm.run(io: io) // Add `myDog` and `myCat` in a same transaction.
```

`RW` type parameter of composed operation is determined by 2 operation types.
```swift
read.flatMap { _ in read }   // Read
read.flatMap { _ in write }  // Write
write.flatMap { _ in read }  // Write
write.flatMap { _ in write } // Write
```

### Use convenient operator

`Realm.IO` provides useful operators to create `RealmIO` instance.

`RealmIO` was inspired by [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/)'s `DBIOAction`.
